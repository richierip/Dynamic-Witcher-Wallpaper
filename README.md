## Installation

Use the Windows Store for an easy install, or visit https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/. If you have the winget utility installed, this should also work:

'''bash
winget install "lively wallpaper"
'''

## Usage

Download this project and drag and drop the colorshift.html file into Lively to import. It is critical that the image source remains in the same folder as this html file, so don't move it around.

## Author + credits

This was a project made from scratch by richierip. Anyone is free to use it.

I was inspired to try this out after finding a similar color-changing wallpaper, though that uses a different method.  Check that out here -> https://github.com/chad-bennett/color-rotate-wallpaper
