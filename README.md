# Dynamic Witcher Wallpaper with Lively

This project provides an image and a background photo that can be used to make an animated desktop wallpaper that goes through a full day/night cycle using the Lively Wallpaper app for Windows.

## Installation

Use the Windows Store for an easy install, or visit https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/. If you have the winget utility installed, this should also work:

```bash
winget install "lively wallpaper"
```

Note - I've only tested this with Lively Wallpaper for Windows 10, but it should work with similar apps for other operating systems. 

## Usage

To see how this looks (on any OS), download the folder and open colorShifter.html in your browser. 

If you want to use this as your background, you'll first need a program (see "Installation" above). Drag and drop the colorShifter.html file directly into Lively to import. It is critical that the image source remains in the same folder as this html file, so don't move it around.

## Author + Credits

This was a project made from scratch by richierip. Anyone is free to use it.

I was inspired to try this out after finding a similar color-changing wallpaper, though that uses a different method.  Check that out here -> https://github.com/chad-bennett/color-rotate-wallpaper
